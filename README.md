**Fibratus** is a tool which is able to capture the most of the Windows kernel activity - process/thread creation and termination, 
file system I/O, registry, network activity, DLL loading/unloading and much more. 
Fibratus has a very simple CLI which encapsulates the machinery to start the kernel event stream collector, 
enable filters or run the lightweight Python modules called **filaments**.
