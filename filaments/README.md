Fibratus incorporates a framework for painlessly extending the functionality and incorporating new features via Python scripts. 
These scripts are called **filaments**. You can also think of them as extension points with virtually endless possibilities. 
Whatever you are allowed to craft in Python, you can also implement in filaments.

Visit the [documentation](https://www.fibratus.io/#/filaments/writing) for a walkthrough on writing a filament from scratch.

### Available filaments
